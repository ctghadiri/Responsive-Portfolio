      <p>I am currently a full-time student at the UC Berkeley Extension Boot Camp studying a full-stack with interests in working in the area of back-end web engineer. The full stack flex program gives me experience with web development tech like JavaScript, jQuery, Git, Node.js, MongoDB, and React.js. </p>

      <p>In addition to the education I have experience working in time-sensitive environments requiring multitasking multiple projects, large and small, while adapting to new technologies. Through my experiences I have become strong team player who is detail oriented and adaptable to meet any challenges that i have an opportunity to tackle.</p>
